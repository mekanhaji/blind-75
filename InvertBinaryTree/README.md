# [226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/ "LeetCode")

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Example 1:
<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert1-tree.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    
    Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
    Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
    
### Example 2:
   <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert2-tree.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
    
    Input: root = [2,1,3]
    Output: [2,3,1]
    
### Example 3:
    Input: root = []
    Output: []
### Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100.
